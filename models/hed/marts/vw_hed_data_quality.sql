/*
  Higher Education Data Quality Monitor
  
  Purpose: Monitor data completeness, validity, and freshness for HED records
  
  Quality Checks (now modular):
  - Record completeness (dq_hed__completeness)
  - Data validity (dq_hed__validity)
  - Duplicate detection (dq_hed__duplicates)
  - Data freshness tracking (dq_hed__freshness)
  
  Use Cases:
  - Daily data quality monitoring
  - Integration health checks
  - Data governance reporting
  - Issue detection and alerting
