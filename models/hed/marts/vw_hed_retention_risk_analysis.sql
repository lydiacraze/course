/*
  Student Retention Risk Analysis
  
  Purpose: Identify and analyze students at risk of dropping out
  
  Risk Factors Analyzed:
  - Academic standing (probation, warning, suspension)
  - Low engagement (course views, assignment submissions)
  - Poor completion rates
  - Financial aid needs
  - Intervention history
  
  Use Cases:
  - Early warning system for advisors
  - Targeted intervention planning
  - Retention program effectiveness
  
  Dependencies:
  - int_hed__risk_levels (provides all risk categorizations)
