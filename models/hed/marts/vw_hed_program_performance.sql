  Academic Program Performance by Major
  
  Purpose: Analyze student outcomes across different academic programs
  
  Metrics by Program:
  - Enrollment numbers
  - Academic performance (GPA, completion rates)
  - Student engagement levels
  - Retention risk
  - Financial aid utilization
  
  Use Cases:
  - Program review and assessment
  - Resource allocation decisions
  - Curriculum improvement initiatives
  - Advisor workload balancing
